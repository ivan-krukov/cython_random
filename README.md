# cython_random

Cython library for random number generation

This library uses a 64 bit Mersenne Twister algorithm to provide a fast and high resolution random number generation library for people coding in Cython. The code should be platform independent and has been tested on Windows 10, Ubuntu 16.04, and multiple versions of macOS. However, you must be using a 64 bit version of Python for this.

The code for random number generation and seeding was lifted directly from the C implementation of the code created by Matsumoto and Nishimura.

## Installation

Standard `setup.py` included. To build, run:

```bash
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

# Testing

The script test_cython_random.py tests out if the library installed properly. If you get any errors, the installation failed. If you get a message saying it has installed correctly, you are fine. These tests were created to ensure that this library produces the same output as the implementation from Nishimura and Matsumoto above.
